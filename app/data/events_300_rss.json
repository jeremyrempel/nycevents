In this updated version of the story, El Dorado is discovered in Sunset Park as a contemporary archeological site. This installation promotes ideas of transformation, immigration, and community. It honors the opportunities that this city offers to newcomers, but most of all, it acknowledges the labor and efforts that immigrants contribute in return.

La Guardia in 1942. Today, Gracie Mansion is occupied by the de Blasio family, which has opened its doors in the spirit of the administration&#39;s motto: one city, rising together.<\/p>\n\n<p>In celebration of our 75th Anniversary of Gracie being a mayoral residence, Mayor de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray have introduced a new art installation, titled <em>New York 1942<\/em>. This is the second in a series of installations envisioning New York through the framework of Gracie Mansion as it has been inhabited over time. It includes artwork, documents and objects from the period that the La Guardias lived in Gracie, shown together to tell a more complete story of the overall historic context as perceived from diverse perspectives.<\/p>\n\n<p>To RSVP for tour, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/on.nyc.gov\/gracietour\">on.nyc.gov\/gracietour<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Gracie Mansion is not offering group tours.

The rows take place in five-person wooden rowboats that Village Community Boathouse builds onsite. The rows last, depending on river conditions and rower level experience, between one and three hours.Most of these rows have mixed crews with those that have never been on the river before and some old hands.
