The rows take place in five-person wooden rowboats that Village Community Boathouse builds onsite. The rows last, depending on river conditions and rower level experience, between one and three hours.Most of these rows have mixed crews with those that have never been on the river before and some old hands.

While our community rowing programs are free, our facilities, boats and equipment require regular upkeep and repair.

Little did he know that, more than 200 years later, his home would be serving as the official residence of the First Family of New York City&mdash;a place where history is made, not merely recorded.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a historic house museum run by NYC Parks, sitting on 11 acres of grounds now known as Carl Schurz Park, Gracie Mansion has served as the home of 10 mayors, beginning first with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1942. Today, Gracie Mansion is occupied by the de Blasio family, which has opened its doors in the spirit of the administration&#39;s motto: one city, rising together.<\/p>\n\n<p>In celebration of our 75th Anniversary of Gracie being a mayoral residence, Mayor de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray have introduced a new art installation, titled <em>New York 1942<\/em>. This is the second in a series of installations envisioning New York through the framework of Gracie Mansion as it has been inhabited over time. It includes artwork, documents and objects from the period that the La Guardias lived in Gracie, shown together to tell a more complete story of the overall historic context as perceived from diverse perspectives.<\/p>\n\n<p>To RSVP for tour, please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/on.nyc.gov\/gracietour\">on.nyc.gov\/gracietour<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Gracie Mansion is not offering group tours.

Little did he know that, more than 200 years later, his home would be serving as the official residence of the First Family of New York City&mdash;a place where history is made, not merely recorded.<\/p>\n\n<p>As a historic house museum run by NYC Parks, sitting on 11 acres of grounds now known as Carl Schurz Park, Gracie Mansion has served as the home of 10 mayors, beginning first with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1942. Today, Gracie Mansion is occupied by the de Blasio family, which has opened its doors in the spirit of the administration&#39;s motto: one city, rising together.<\/p>\n\n<p>In celebration of our 75th Anniversary of Gracie being a mayoral residence, Mayor de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray have introduced a new art installation, titled New York 1942. This is the second in a series of installations envisioning New York through the framework of Gracie Mansion as it has been inhabited over time. It includes artwork, documents and objects from the period that the La Guardias lived in Gracie, shown together to tell a more complete story of the overall historic context as perceived from diverse perspectives.<\/p>\n\n<p>To RSVP for a tour, please visit on.nyc.gov\/gracietour. <\/p>\n\n<p>Currently, Gracie Mansion is not offering group tours. If you are part of a private organization that would like to tour the house, please email your request, including the size of group, your name and the purpose of a tour, to gracieinfo@cityhall.nyc.gov and we will work to add you to one of the currently scheduled tours.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photo ID required for entrance.

The Village Community Boathouse offers free community rowing on Sundays at noon and on Tuesdays at 5:30 p.m., through November 12, 2017.<\/p>\n\n<p>Community rowing is free and open to all; no experience or reservations necessary, and lifejackets will be provided. Children (under 18) must be accompanied by a parent. All participants must sign a liability waiver.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Please note:<\/strong> It is very important that you arrive between noon and 12:30 p.m., as the Village Community Boathouse pair their boats, coxswains, and rowers by 12:30. Boats leave right after for the afternoon. In some cases, the Villiage Community Boathouse will have additional boats leaving at a later time but the chances to get out on a boat then are much slimmer. Please check the Villiage Community Boathouse&#39;s social media feeds on <a href=\"http:\/\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VCBoathouse\/\">Facebook<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/VCBoathouseNYC\">Twitter<\/a> for possible last-minute changes due to weather or other circumstances. Or, call (212) 229-2059.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>About Free Community Rowing<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Community Rows are free sessions that include a basic introduction to rowing for first timers (safety orientation, rowing technique, and terminology) and of course plenty of actual rowing on the Hudson River. The rows take place in five-person wooden rowboats that Village Community Boathouse builds onsite. The rows last, depending on river conditions and rower level experience, between one and three hours.Most of these rows have mixed crews with those that have never been on the river before and some old hands.

Rowling&#39;s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. The year is 1926, and Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident, were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) namedJacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt&#39;s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rain date: August 17<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/summer-outdoor-movie-night-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-tickets-34933557210\">Get tickets on Eventbrite<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1884944615106256\/?context=create&previousaction=create&source=1&sid_create=3553603116&action_history=[%7B%22mechanism%22%3A%22page_create_dialog%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22create_dialog%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22[]%22%7D%2C%7B%22mechanism%22%3A%22surface%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22permalink%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22[]%22%7D%2C%7B%22mechanism%22%3A%22user_create_dialog%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22create_dialog%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22[]%22%7D%2C%7B%22mechanism%22%3A%22surface%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22permalink%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22[]%22%7D%2C%7B%22surface%22%3A%22create_dialog%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22user_create_dialog%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A[]%7D]&has_source=1\">Link to Event Facebook Page<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/p><p>Start time: 8:30 pm<\/p><p>End time: 11:00 pm<\/p><p>Contact phone: <\/p><p>Location: North Lawn (in Stuyvesant Square)<\/p>","parkids":"M086","parknames":"Stuyvesant Square","startdate":"2017-07-20","enddate":"2017-07-20","starttime":"8:30 pm","endtime":"11:00 pm","contact_phone":null,"location":"North Lawn (in Stuyvesant Square)","categories":"Accessible | Nature | Film | Best for Kids | Free Summer Movies","coordinates":"40.73418920855100000, -73.98416721820800000","image":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/common_images\/events\/592a4eeac39b4.jpg","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:00:03 EDT"},{"title":"Journey to the Stars","guid":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2017\/07\/20\/journey-to-the-stars","link":"http:\/\/www.nycgovparks.org\/events\/2017\/07\/20\/journey-to-the-stars","description":"<p>Date: July 20, 2017<\/p><p><p>Gaze across the New York sky and all the wonders it holds with Amateur Astronomers Association of New York.
